* Perform CRUD actions across related tables

### What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is a language that allows us to do:

* Store / persist information
* Manipulate that information

SQLite3 is a relational database.

Some specific actions that we can do are CRUD actions, a common acronym we'll see throughout the program, web development, and computing in general:

* Create data
* Read data
* Update data
* Delete data

### Practice SQL CRUD

Investigate the schema of the database; the structure of the database. If in the command line, use `.schema`, if in browser, use "Database Structure" tab.

After each challenge, check the database structure to verify that the changes were made successfully.
