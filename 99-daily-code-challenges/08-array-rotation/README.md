# Left Rotation

A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then the array would become `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.

Example IO:
```
rot_left([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4)
=> [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
rot_left([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)
=> [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
```

Notes:
If the rotation number is greater than the length of the array, rotation should continue as shown in the second example above.
