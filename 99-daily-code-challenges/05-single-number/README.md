# Single Number

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *twice* except
for one. Return that single element.

## Example

For the input `nums = [1, 1, 2]`, the output should be `single_number(nums) = 2`

### Hints

Think about what kind of data structure may be best for counting frequencies of
occurrances.

## Sample I/O

```
input: [1, 1, 2]
output: 2

input: [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
output: 4

input: [12, 13, 5, 13, 4, 5, 4]
output: 12
```
