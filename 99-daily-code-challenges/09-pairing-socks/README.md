# Sock Pairs
John works at a clothing store. He has a large pile of socks that he must pair
by color for sale. Given an array of integers representing the color of each
sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.

For example, given `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2]` there is one pair of the color `1`,
one pair of the color `2` and one sock of each color `1`, `2` and `3` left over.

## Example

```
Input: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 2
```
